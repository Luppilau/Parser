This folder contains examples of "FM4FUN" programs in F# and Java tha read an arithmetic expression from the command line and print the result of evaluating such expression.

## Files

F#/FsLexYacc
* [FM4FUNLexer.fsl](FM4FUNLexer.fsl): The F# lexer for arithmetic expressions
* [FM4FUNParser.fsp](FM4FUNParser.fsp): The F# parser for arithmetic expressions
* [FM4FUNTypesAST.fs](FM4FUNTypesAST.fs): F# types for AST of arithmetic expressions
* [FM4FUN.fsx](FM4FUN.fsx): The F# script for the FM4FUN

Java/ANTLR4
* [FM4FUN.g](FM4FUN.g): The ANTLR4 grammar for arithmetic expressions.
* [FM4FUN.java](FM4FUN.java): The Java FM4FUN, which uses the parser generated by ANTLR4.

## Instructions for F# #/FSLexYacc

This is instructions assume that you have followed the guidelines to [getting started with F# and FSLexYacc](getting-started-fs.md) and that you are using a terminal on a folder contaning the F# files mentioned above.

Invoke the lexer generator with 

```
mono FsLexYacc.10.0.0/build/fslex/net46/fslex.exe FM4FUNLexer.fsl --unicode
```

Invoke the parser generator with 

```
mono FsLexYacc.10.0.0/build/fsyacc/net46/fsyacc.exe FM4FUNParser.fsp --module FM4FUNParser
```

Invoke the FM4FUN with

```
fsharpi FM4FUN.fsx
```

You should be able to interact with the FM4FUN program as follows:

```
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1
1.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2
3.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2 * 3
7.0
```

## Instructions for Java/ANTLR

This is instructions assume that you have followed the guidelines to [getting started with Java and ANLTR4](getting-started-java.md) and that you are using a terminal on a folder contaning [FM4FUN.g](FM4FUN.g) and [FM4FUN.java](FM4FUN.java).

Generate the visitor-based parser with

```
antlr4 -visitor -no-listener FM4FUN.g
```

Compile the program with

```
javac *.java
```

Run the program with

```
java FM4FUN
```

You should be able to interact with the FM4FUN program as follows:

```
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1
1.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2
3.0
Enter an arithmetic expression: 1 + 2 * 3
7.0
```
